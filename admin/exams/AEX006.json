        },
        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "A shift register is a digital circuit specifically designed to convert data between serial and parallel formats. It can load data in parallel and shift it out bit-by-bit (parallel-in, serial-out), or load data bit-by-bit and then output it all at once (serial-in, parallel-out)."

            "a": "high power dissipation",
            "b": "high voltage handling",
            "c": "low power dissipation"
        },
        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology is prized for its extremely low static power dissipation, as in any given logic state, one of the complementary transistors is always off."

        "question_number": 76,
        "question": "A parallel register:",
        "options": {
            "a": "requires a clock pulse for each bit",
            "b": "reads each bit to be stored symultaneously",
            "c": "reads the stored data when logic 0 is applied to the read line"
        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "A parallel register, also known as a parallel-in, parallel-out (PIPO) register, has inputs for each bit, allowing it to load or read all bits of a data word simultaneously on a single clock edge."

            "b": "is monochrome",
            "c": "has infinite colours"
        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "A color LCD display creates its full spectrum of colors by using an array of pixels, where each pixel is composed of three sub-pixels: one red, one green, and one blue (RGB). All other colors are created by varying the intensity of these three primary colors."

            "c": "twine(100% cotton)"
        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "To maintain a static-safe environment, Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD) bags are properly sealed using conductive or antistatic tape, which is often incorporated into an ESD warning label."

    {
        "question_number": 79,
        "question": "What precautions are required when removing ESD equipment?",
        "options": {
            "a": "wear a wrist strap conected to an approved ground point",
            "b": "no special precautions are required",
            "c": "keep one hand on the airframe"
        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The most important precaution when handling any Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD) is to be properly grounded to prevent a static discharge from your body to the component. This is typically achieved by wearing a tested ESD wrist strap connected to a verified ground point."

        "question_number": 80,
        "question": "A flight deck CRT LRU is being replaced. What does the ESD label indicate?",
        "options": {
            "a": "wrist straps should be worn",
            "b": "do not touch plug pins or leave them exposed",
            "c": "remove power before connecting"
        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "An ESD warning label signifies that the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) is sensitive to static electricity. The most direct way to damage such a device is by touching its connector pins, so the label serves as a critical warning to handle the device carefully and avoid touching the contacts."

        "question_number": 81,
        "question": "With a relative humidity of 10% to 20%, if you walked over a carpet what electrostatic voltage value would you expect to see?",
        "options": {
            "a": "35, 000 volts",

        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Static electricity generation is significantly increased in low-humidity environments. Walking across a carpet in very dry conditions (10-20% humidity) can generate extremely high static potentials, with 35,000 volts being a commonly cited value for this scenario."

        "options": {
            "a": "resistance between skin and strap end plug is more than 10 megaohms",
            "b": "resistance between skin and strap end plug is more than 1 megaohms",
            "c": "resistance between strap and strap end plug is more than 1 megaohms"
        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "When testing an ESD wrist strap, you are verifying the integrity of the built-in safety resistor. This resistor, typically 1 Megaohm ($1 M//Omega$), is included to protect the user from accidental electric shock. Therefore, you should check that the resistance from the user to the ground connection is approximately 1 M\u03a9."
