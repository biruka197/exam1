        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "A PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) thermistor's resistance increases significantly as it heats up due to overcurrent. This increased resistance limits the current flow, protecting the circuit.  An NTC thermistor's resistance decreases with increasing temperature, making it unsuitable for this purpose."
