    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "For takeoff, a low angle of attack and high power provides maximum acceleration. While stationary, a higher angle of attack would create more thrust, but the statement implies a *low* angle of attack for maximum takeoff thrust, making only No. 1 true."

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The pilot adjusts the RPM control, which changes the tension on the governor's speeder spring, thus altering the load against the flyweights and setting the desired RPM."
