        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Helicopters, especially single-rotor types, require the center of gravity to be kept very close to the rotor mast for stability and control, resulting in a much more restricted (narrower) CG range compared to most fixed-wing aircraft."

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Placing ballast at the farthest possible point from the CG creates the longest arm, allowing for the maximum change in moment with the minimum amount of weight added."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A center of gravity that is too far aft (rearward loading) makes the aircraft longitudinally unstable, which can lead to oscillations and a dangerous tendency to spin."

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A forward CG requires more up-elevator or nose-up trim to maintain level flight. This increases the tail-down force and induced drag, resulting in a lower cruising speed for a given power setting."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Fuel depletion and landing gear movement both involve a change in the distribution of mass, shifting the CG. An engine flameout stops the engine but does not in itself shift the aircraft's center of gravity."
