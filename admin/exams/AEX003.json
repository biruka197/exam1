        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The 0.7V value represents the typical forward voltage drop required to overcome the potential barrier of a silicon P-N junction. 0.3V is the characteristic voltage for a germanium diode, while 1.1V is closer to the bandgap energy of silicon, not its forward voltage drop."

        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Pentavalent (5-electron) atoms donate a free electron to the semiconductor lattice, creating an excess of negative charge carriers (electrons). This results in an N-type (Negative-type) material. Doping with trivalent (3-electron) atoms creates P-type material."

        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "A Zener diode is designed to operate in its reverse breakdown region, where it maintains a nearly constant voltage across its terminals despite changes in current. This property makes it ideal for use as a voltage regulator."

        },
        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "In an NPN transistor, the collector-base junction must be reverse-biased for active region operation. This requires the collector to be more positive than the base, and since the base is more positive than the emitter (forward-biased EB junction), the collector must also be significantly more positive than the emitter."

        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "A BJT's two primary modes of operation are as an amplifier (in the active region, where output current is a magnified version of the input current) and as a switch (operating between the cutoff 'off' state and the saturation 'on' state)."

        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "By convention, the arrow on the emitter of a BJT symbol always points in the direction of conventional current flow. For an NPN transistor, it points away from the base; for a PNP, it points toward the base."

        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Active region operation requires the emitter-base junction to be forward-biased (Vb > Ve) and the collector-base junction to be reverse-biased (Vc > Vb). Therefore, the collector must be at a higher positive potential than the base."

        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Based on Kirchhoff's Current Law, the current flowing into the emitter terminal (Ie) is the sum of the currents flowing out of the collector (Ic) and base (Ib) terminals. Thus, Ie = Ib + Ic."

Rechecking the provided answer image indicates (303.74)8 and (C3.F)16 might have a typo in the octal conversion. Let's re-convert the provided correct answer: Binary 11000011 is (303) in octal. Binary .1111 is (.74) in octal. Hex 1100 is C, Hex 0011 is 3, Hex 1111 is F. So the correct conversion is (303.74)\u2088 and (C3.F)\u2081\u2086."
