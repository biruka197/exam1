        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "**Line of sight communication** perfectly describes VHF and UHF radio waves that travel in straight lines and are blocked by the curvature of the Earth or terrain. **Skywave propagation** is characteristic of HF radio, where signals bounce off the ionosphere to travel over the horizon. **Tropospheric scatter** is a specialized method that uses particles in the troposphere to scatter signals over the horizon, which is not a standard aviation communication method."

        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "A **differential pressure capsule** (or aneroid capsule) is precisely this: two sealed, flexible diaphragms that expand or contract based on pressure changes, used in instruments like altimeters and airspeed indicators. A **Bourdon tube** is a C-shaped or helical tube that uncoils with pressure, used for measuring very high pressures (e.g., hydraulics). A **Bellows assembly** is a single, accordion-like chamber and is less common for the precise measurements of differential capsules."

        "explanation": "A **Bourdon tube** is a simple, robust mechanical device capable of accurately measuring the very high pressures (e.g., 3000 PSI) found in hydraulic and oxygen systems. An **aneroid barometer** (or capsule) is used for measuring much lower atmospheric pressures for altitude and airspeed. A **manometer** uses a column of liquid to measure pressure and is impractical for the high pressures and dynamic environment of an aircraft."

            "c": "Global Positioning System (GPS)"
        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The **Instrument Landing System (ILS)** is the standard precision approach system that uses separate ground transmitters (a localizer for lateral and a glideslope for vertical guidance) to guide an aircraft to the runway. A **VOR** provides lateral guidance *to* a station but lacks the precision and vertical guidance for a landing. While **GPS** can provide both, and is used for precision approaches (LPV), the ILS is the system specifically defined by its lateral and vertical ground transmitters for this purpose."

        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "**Rigidity in space**, or gyroscopic inertia, is the fundamental principle that a spinning rotor will maintain its orientation in space unless acted upon by an external force. **Precession** is the effect where a force applied to a gyroscope is felt 90 degrees later in the direction of rotation. **Gimbal lock** is a condition where two of a gyroscope's three gimbals become aligned, causing it to lose its ability to measure rotation in one plane."

        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The 'S' in Mode S stands for 'Select,' meaning each aircraft has a unique address. This **allows ATC's Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) to selectively interrogate a single aircraft**, reducing radio frequency congestion and allowing for more efficient data exchange compared to older modes that caused all aircraft in a beam to reply. While Mode S can transmit some data, it does not inherently send weather or heading information; that is a function of other systems like ADS-B which *uses* Mode S."

        "options": {
            "a": "A failure of the aircraft's magnetic heading input",

        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The VOR 'flag' (often a red NAV or VOR flag) appears when the receiver's internal monitoring circuits detect that the received signal from the ground station is **too weak, absent, or corrupted** to provide reliable navigation. A failure of the magnetic heading input would affect the RMI/HSI display but not necessarily cause a NAV flag. Selecting the wrong course is a pilot action and does not indicate a signal validity problem."

        "explanation": "The primary function of the airborne DME unit (the interrogator) is to **transmit a pair of pulses and measure the precise time it takes to receive a reply** from the ground station (transponder). This round-trip time, minus a fixed delay, is converted into slant range distance. Receiving the Morse ID is a function of the associated VOR receiver. Selecting the paired frequency is an automatic function of the radio tuning unit, not the interrogator itself."

        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "To ensure that the transponder's signal can be received by ground radar and TCAS-equipped aircraft from any angle, aircraft are equipped with two antennas: one on the **top of the fuselage and one on the bottom**. The system automatically selects the antenna that is providing the best coverage at any given moment. Locating them on wingtips or stabilizers would result in signal blockage by the fuselage."

        "question": "When GPS enters 'Aided Mode,' it is temporarily using data from what other system to augment its calculations?",
        "options": {
            "a": "The VOR receivers",

        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "GPS aiding, or 'Aided Mode,' refers to the integration of GPS data with data from an **Inertial Reference Unit (IRU)**. The IRU provides very accurate short-term velocity and attitude data, which helps the GPS receiver reacquire satellite signals faster after a brief outage and helps filter out erroneous measurements, providing a more stable and accurate navigation solution."

        },
        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "By using initial position, velocity, and time data from the allied IRU, the GPS receiver can drastically narrow its search for satellite signals, reducing the 'Time to First Fix' (TTFF) from several minutes (a 'cold start') to as little as **30 seconds**. The other timeframes are more typical of un-aided or cold starts."

        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Having antennas on both the top and bottom **provides better reception during turns** when one antenna might be 'shadowed' or blocked by the fuselage itself. The system can select the antenna receiving the strongest signal. ADF is a receive-only system, so it does not transmit. ADF antennas cannot receive the VHF signals from VORs."

        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "DME operates in the UHF band (around 1 GHz), which allows for a physically **small, low-profile blade-type antenna**, usually located on the belly of the aircraft. A **long wire antenna** is for low-frequency systems like HF. A **large parabolic dish** is used for weather radar."

            "b": "By measuring the time it takes for a radio signal's round trip",
            "c": "By using triangulation between multiple ground stations"
        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "DME works by **measuring the elapsed time** between the transmission of an interrogation pulse and the reception of a reply pulse from the ground station. Since radio waves travel at a known speed (the speed of light), this time can be directly converted into distance. Signal strength is not a reliable measure of distance. Triangulation is used by other systems like VOR/VOR fixes, but not by a single DME."

        "question_number": 72,
        "question": "Why does DME use UHF instead of the VHF used by its paired VOR?",
        "options": {
            "a": "UHF allows for the necessary bandwidth and reduces interference with VHF communications",
            "b": "UHF signals can travel further than VHF signals",
            "c": "UHF is less affected by weather than VHF"
        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Using a separate band (UHF) **prevents interference** with the VHF NAV and COM bands. Furthermore, the pulse techniques used by DME require a wider bandwidth than is available in the VHF NAV band. In reality, line-of-sight VHF signals travel slightly further than UHF signals. Both are largely unaffected by weather."

The **demodulator** is part of the receiver circuit; it performs the opposite function. An **audio amplifier** is found in both the transmitter (before the modulator) and the receiver (after the demodulator), but the modulator is unique to the transmitter."

        "question": "To call an aircraft using SELCAL, a ground station uses which communication system?",
        "options": {
            "a": "Primarily VHF or HF radio",
            "b": "Only the SATCOM system",
            "c": "A dedicated SELCAL frequency"
        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "SELCAL is not a communication system itself, but a signalling method sent *over* an existing communication system. Ground stations transmit the SELCAL tones **over their standard VHF (if in range) or HF (for long range) radios**. While SELCAL can be sent via SATCOM, it is most commonly associated with VHF/HF. There is no single, dedicated frequency just for SELCAL."
