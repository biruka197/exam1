  {
    "question_number": 11,
    "question": "What is the principal structural member of a wing, responsible for carrying most of the bending loads?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Spar.",
      "b": "Rib.",
      "c": "Stringer."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The spar is the main spanwise beam of the wing and carries the primary flight loads. Ribs give the wing its shape, and stringers stiffen the skin."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 12,
    "question": "What type of fuselage construction uses only the skin, without an internal framework, to carry the primary structural loads?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Pure monocoque.",
      "b": "Semi-monocoque.",
      "c": "Truss frame."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "A pure monocoque design relies only on its skin for strength, like an egg. A semi-monocoque design, which is more common, reinforces the skin with an internal structure."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 13,
    "question": "What is the basic difference in how fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft generate lift?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Fixed-wing require forward motion; rotary-wing require blade rotation.",
      "b": "Fixed-wing use engines for lift; rotary-wing use aerodynamics.",
      "c": "Fixed-wing rely on wings; rotary-wing rely on the fuselage."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Fixed-wing aircraft need forward airspeed to generate lift over static wings. Rotary-wing aircraft create their own airflow by rotating their blades (wings)."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 14,
    "question": "Which type of trim tab moves in the *same* direction as the primary control surface it is attached to?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Anti-servo tab.",
      "b": "Servo tab.",
      "c": "Balance tab."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "An anti-servo tab moves in the same direction to increase control feel and stability. Servo and balance tabs move in the opposite direction to make controls easier to move."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 15,
    "question": "How do spoilers assist in rolling the aircraft?",
    "options": {
      "a": "They raise on the wing with the upward-moving aileron.",
      "b": "They raise on the wing with the downward-moving aileron.",
      "c": "They raise on both wings simultaneously."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Spoilers assist a roll by raising on the same wing where the aileron moves up. This 'spoils' or dumps lift on that wing, causing it to drop faster."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 16,
    "question": "What are the primary, lengthwise, load-carrying members of the fuselage called?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Longerons.",
      "b": "Formers.",
      "c": "Spars."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Longerons are the main longitudinal beams of the fuselage. Formers are the cross-sectional frames, and spars are the main beams in the wing."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 17,
    "question": "How is the angle of incidence measured?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Between the wing chord line and the fuselage's longitudinal axis.",
      "b": "Between the wing chord line and the relative wind.",
      "c": "Between the wing's leading edge and the horizontal stabilizer."
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The angle of incidence is the fixed, built-in angle between the wing and the fuselage. The angle between the wing and the relative wind is the angle of attack."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 18,
    "question": "Which type of wing design requires additional external support, such as struts or wires?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Semi-cantilever wing",
      "b": "Full cantilever wing",
      "c": "Monocoque wing"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "A semi-cantilever wing requires external bracing (struts or wires) to assist its internal structure. A full cantilever wing is entirely self-supporting."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 19,
    "question": "What term refers to a distance measured from a reference line along the longitudinal axis of the fuselage?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Body station",
      "b": "Water line",
      "c": "Buttock line"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "A body station is a longitudinal reference point along the fuselage. A water line is a vertical reference, and a buttock line is a lateral (width) reference."

  {
    "question_number": 20,
    "question": "In a wing structure that uses a combination of struts and wires, what type of load do the wires primarily carry?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Tension load",
      "b": "Compression load",
      "c": "Torsion load"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Wires are strong only when pulled, so they are used exclusively to carry tension loads. Rigid struts are used to carry compression (pushing) loads."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 21,
    "question": "Which of the following fuselage requirements is not mandatory for all types of aircraft?",
    "options": {
