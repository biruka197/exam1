        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "DME calculates the direct line-of-sight distance (slant range) to a DME ground station by timing the round trip of a radio pulse."

        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The ground station 'squitters' or transmits random pulses so that receivers can maintain a lock on the station even when not actively interrogating it."
