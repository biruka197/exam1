    "options": {
      "a": "Directional",
      "b": "Dynamic",
      "c": "Dutch roll"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "A Dutch Roll is an aircraft motion consisting of an out-of-phase combination of yaw and roll. Dutch roll stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a yaw damper."

    "question": "Airbrakes are used to increase",
    "options": {
      "a": "Lift",
      "b": "Drag",
      "c": "Pitch",
      "d": "Thrust"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The aircraft uses airbrakes to increase drag. The purpose of increasing drag is to slow down the aircraft. These brakes are usually surfaces that emerge out from the fuselage."

    "question": "Which of the following axes passes from wingtip to wingtip through an aircraft?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Vertical axis",
      "b": "Transverse axis",
      "c": "Longitudinal axis"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The transverse axis passes from wingtip to wingtip through an aircraft. It may also be called the lateral axis. Rotation along this axis is called pitch, which is controlled by elevators."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 53,
    "question": "Why are flaps deflected downwards?",
    "options": {
      "a": "To decrease lift",
      "b": "To decrease the effective curvature of the wing",
      "c": "To increase the effective curvature of the wing"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Flaps are deflected downwards to increase the effective curvature of the wing. Flaps are used during descent or take off. They are used to reduce stalling speed of an aircraft and are mostly used during low speed."

    "question": "Which of the following is not a part of flight control systems?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Ailerons",
      "b": "Elevators",
      "c": "Radars"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Radars are not a part of flight control systems. However, ailerons, elevators and flaps are all part of the flight control systems. Some other flight control systems are elevens and flaperons."

    "question": "The rudder is a part of",
    "options": {
      "a": "Undercarriage",
      "b": "Empennage",
      "c": "APU"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The rudder is a part of the empennage. More specifically, it is mounted on the vertical stabilizer, at the rear end of the aircraft. If the pilot pushes the left pedal, rudder is deflected left and similarly when the pilot pushes the right pedal, rudder is deflected right."

    "question_number": 56,
    "question": "What is the rotation about longitudinal axis called?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Roll",
      "b": "Pitch",
      "c": "Yaw"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The axis passing through the aircraft from nose to tail is called as longitudinal axis. Rotation about the longitudinal axis is called roll. Further, the angular displacement about it is called bank."

    "question_number": 57,
    "question": "Which of the following is not a secondary control?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Slats",
      "b": "Ailerons",
      "c": "Spoilers"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The ailerons are part of the primary cockpit flight controls. The roll and pitch of the aircraft can be adjusted using the ailerons. Slats, spoilers and air brakes are part of the secondary flight controls."
