    "question": "What are the four main parts of an autopilot?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Computer, Controller, sensors, ac power",
      "b": "Sensors, computer, controller, servos",
      "c": "controller, servos, computer, switches"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The four fundamental components of an autopilot system are: Sensors (like gyros) to detect the aircraft's attitude, a Computer to process the sensor data, a Controller for the pilot to select modes, and Servos (actuators) to physically move the flight controls. Option 'a' is incorrect because AC power is a power source, not a core functional component. Option 'c' is incorrect because 'switches' are part of the controller, and 'servos' is the more accurate term for the actuators."
