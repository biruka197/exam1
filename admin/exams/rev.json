    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "If air is tapped from the engine compressors for bleed air services, it reduces the amount of air available for combustion in the engine. As result, the temperature of the remaining air, known as the exhaust gas temperature (EGT), tends to increase. This is because the reduced airflow means that less air available to cool the engine components and dilute the combustion gases, leading to higher temperatures. "
