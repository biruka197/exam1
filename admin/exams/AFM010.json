        "c": "57.16lbs"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "To find the ballast weight (w), the following formula is used: w = W * (CG_new - CG_old) / (Arm_ballast - CG_new). w = 4954 * (32.0 - 30.5) / (162 - 32.0) = 4954 * 1.5 / 130 = 57.16 lbs. This is the minimum weight needed to move the CG to the forward limit of +32.0 inches."

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",

        "c": "Reduction of long range optimum speed"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",

      "question": "A large aircraft has a calculated weight of 385,000 pounds and is taking off with a fuel burn of 1,200 pounds per minute. If the crew wants to determine the stabilizer trim setting every minute, how often should they re-check the aircraft's weight?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Every 30 seconds",
        "B": "Every minute",
        "C": "Every 5 minutes",
        "D": "Never, as the weight does not affect the trim setting"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Stabilizer trim is set once before takeoff based on the CG at takeoff weight. It is not typically re-checked on a minute-by-minute basis. However, the question implies a need for frequent re-checking; in a dynamic situation, weight changes continuously with fuel burn."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 120,
      "question": "A large aircraft has a calculated weight of 395,000 pounds and is taking off with a CG of 27.5% MAC. Is this within the acceptable range?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Yes",
        "B": "No, it is too far aft",
        "C": "No, it is too far forward",
        "D": "It depends on the aircraft and its performance requirements"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Whether a CG of 27.5% MAC is acceptable depends entirely on the specific aircraft's certified CG envelope. Without the specific aircraft's data, a definitive answer isn't possible, but 27.5% is a plausible value within the typical range for many large aircraft."

    {
      "question_number": 121,
      "question": "A large aircraft is taking off with a stabilizer trim setting of 1,200 units, which was set for maximum weight. The aircraft has now burned 10,000 pounds of fuel, which has reduced the weight to 385,000 pounds. Should the stabilizer trim setting be increased or decreased?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increased to 1,500 units",
        "B": "Decreased to 1,000 units",
        "C": "Remain at 1,200 units",
        "D": "Increase to 1,800 units"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "As fuel is burned, the aircraft's weight decreases and the CG shifts. The stabilizer trim will be adjusted throughout the flight to maintain proper trim for the changing conditions. The exact change depends on where the fuel was located."

    {
      "question_number": 122,
      "question": "A large aircraft has a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 600,000 pounds. The pilot plans to take off with a fuel load of 200,000 pounds, and the aircraft's empty weight is 350,000 pounds. What is the aircraft's payload capacity?",
      "options": {
        "A": "50,000 pounds",
        "B": "100,000 pounds",
        "C": "130,000 pounds",
        "D": "150,000 pounds"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Payload capacity is calculated as: MTOW - Empty Weight - Fuel Load. Calculation: 600,000 lbs - 350,000 lbs - 200,000 lbs = 50,000 lbs."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 123,
      "question": "An aircraft's takeoff weight is 580,000 pounds, and it has burned 20,000 pounds of fuel during the flight. What is the landing weight of the aircraft?",
      "options": {
        "A": "560,000 pounds",
        "B": "570,000 pounds",
        "C": "580,000 pounds",
        "D": "600,000 pounds"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Landing Weight is the Takeoff Weight minus the fuel burned during the flight. Calculation: 580,000 lbs - 20,000 lbs = 560,000 lbs."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 124,
      "question": "A large aircraft is required to reduce its weight by 30,000 pounds for landing. The fuel is carrying 5,000 pounds per minute. How many minutes will it take to dump the required fuel?",
      "options": {
        "A": "5 minutes",
        "B": "6 minutes",
        "C": "7 minutes",
        "D": "8 minutes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The time required to dump fuel is the weight to be dumped divided by the fuel dumping rate. Calculation: 30,000 lbs / 5,000 lbs/min = 6 minutes."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 125,
      "question": "During a flight, an aircraft burns 1,500 pounds of fuel per hour. If the aircraft needs to dump fuel before landing, how many pounds will it have burned in 45 minutes?",
      "options": {
        "A": "750 pounds",
        "B": "1,125 pounds",
        "C": "1,500 pounds",
        "D": "2,250 pounds"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "To find the fuel burned in 45 minutes (0.75 hours), multiply the hourly burn rate by the time in hours. Calculation: 1,500 lbs/hour * 0.75 hours = 1,125 pounds."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 126,
      "question": "What is the standard operating procedure (SOP) regarding fuel dumping before landing, specifically related to weight reduction?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The aircraft must dump fuel to reach the maximum landing weight",
        "B": "The aircraft should not dump fuel at any time.",
        "C": "Fuel dumping is only required in emergencies or if weight exceeds limits.",
        "D": "The aircraft must dump fuel until the fuel tank is empty."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Fuel dumping is not a routine procedure. It is performed only when necessary, such as in an emergency or when the aircraft's weight exceeds the maximum structural landing weight, to allow for a safe landing."
