        "options": {
            "a": "The inductor has a lower DC resistance than the resistor, resulting in less power loss.",

        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "While an inductor's low DC resistance contributes to less power loss (option a), the primary reason LC filters are preferred is their superior ripple rejection.  The inductor's ability to store energy and release it slowly (option b) significantly reduces voltage fluctuations, producing a smoother DC output than an RC filter. Option C, while somewhat true, isn't as fundamental to understanding the advantage of LC filters as the energy storage capability."

        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "With one diode open, the bridge can only conduct during one half-cycle of the AC input. For the other half-cycle, the path is broken. This results in a pulsating DC output with only half of the original AC waveform present, which is the behavior of a half-wave rectifier."

        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Crossover distortion is inherent to Class B push-pull amplifiers. It occurs because there is a small period of time when one transistor has turned off and the other has not yet turned on, creating a 'dead zone' in the output signal near zero volts."

        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "An ideal op-amp amplifies only the difference between its two inputs. If the same 'common-mode' voltage is applied to both, the difference is zero. A high CMRR means the op-amp is very effective at rejecting this common signal, producing a zero output."

        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Applying a reverse bias widens the diode's depletion region, which prevents majority charge carriers from crossing the junction. This results in a very high resistance and allows only a tiny leakage current to flow."
