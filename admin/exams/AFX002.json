      "b": "Lighter than air",
      "c": "Both heavier and lighter than air"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The document classifies aircraft based on how they are supported in the air into two categories: heavier than air and lighter than air[cite: 2, 5, 7]. Therefore, both are valid classifications."

    "options": {
      "a": "fuselage",
      "b": "landing gear",
      "c": "wing"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The landing gear is explicitly mentioned as a principal structural component that doesn't carry flight load[cite: 8]. The fuselage and wings are primary, load-bearing structures. The wing's primary function is to generate lift and carry flight loads [cite: 11], and the fuselage carries loads from the wings and empennage[cite: 9, 36]."

    "question": "Which of the following is not an advantage of the landing gear?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Avoiding nose over",
      "b": "No ground looping problem",
      "c": "Increase lift"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Landing gear is for ground operations like takeoff, landing, and taxiing; it does not contribute to increasing lift, which is a function of the wings and high-lift devices[cite: 10]. Avoiding nose-over and ground looping are advantages associated with specific landing gear configurations like the tricycle gear[cite: 16, 17, 242]."

    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "A Pratt truss is defined as a construction that has longerons, diagonal, and vertical members[cite: 23]. Not having vertical members is a characteristic of a Warren truss[cite: 125], and not having diagonal members would defeat the purpose of a truss structure."

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The document explicitly lists monoplane and biplane as types of fixed-wing aircraft[cite: 25, 26, 496, 497]. A rotorcraft (rotary wing) generates lift with a main rotor [cite: 32], and an airship is a lighter-than-air craft that uses buoyancy[cite: 362]."

      "b": "Lighter than air",
      "c": "Rotary wing"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The main rotor is the component that generates lift in a rotary wing type aircraft, such as a helicopter[cite: 29, 32]. Fixed-wing aircraft use static wings and forward motion to generate lift [cite: 235], while lighter-than-air craft use buoyancy[cite: 7]."

      "b": "Engine cowling",
      "c": "Passenger seats"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The document lists the wing, fuselage, landing gear, stabilizers, and flight control surfaces as the main structural components[cite: 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. A cowling is a removable engine covering [cite: 468, 471] and not a main structural component."

    "options": {
      "a": "To be air-conditioned or ventilated",
      "b": "To be strong & heavy",
      "c": "To be streamlined"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A fuselage must be strong and light, not strong and heavy[cite: 42, 150, 415]. Being heavy is a significant disadvantage in aircraft design. Requirements do include being streamlined and ventilated or air-conditioned[cite: 41, 43, 149, 151, 416]."

      "b": "cap strip and web",
      "c": "stringer and web"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The document explicitly states that the two parts of a spar are the cap strip and the web[cite: 44, 48]. A rib is a separate chord-wise member that gives the wing its shape [cite: 103, 166], and a stringer is a lengthwise member that provides stiffening[cite: 169]."

      "a": "Fuselage",
      "b": "Wing",
      "c": "Stabilizer"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The wing provides attachment points for the landing gear and engine nacelles[cite: 50, 52]. While landing gear can also attach to the fuselage[cite: 493], the wing is a primary attachment location, especially on large aircraft. Stabilizers are used for control and stability and do not typically support engines or landing gear[cite: 137]."

    "options": {
      "a": "Tension",
      "b": "Compression",
      "c": "Shear"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Tension is defined as the stress that pulls an object apart[cite: 56]. Compression is a stress that tends to crush an object [cite: 57], and shear is a stress that tries to slide parts of an object apart[cite: 58]."

  {
    "question_number": 12,
    "question": "The trailing edge flaps increase wing camber and area, which in turn:",
    "options": {
      "a": "increases drag",
      "b": "elongates the landing roll",
      "c": "increases takeoff speed"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "By increasing the wing's camber and area, trailing edge flaps increase both lift and drag[cite: 61, 62, 74, 75]. Increased drag is beneficial during landing as it helps to shorten the landing roll, not elongate it. Flaps decrease, rather than increase, the required takeoff and landing speeds."

    "question_number": 13,
    "question": "Which of the following is a general type of fuselage construction?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Truss",
      "b": "Cantilever",
      "c": "Stressed Skin"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The document lists three general types of fuselage construction: Truss, Full Monocoque, and Semi-Monocoque[cite: 65, 66, 67, 68]. Cantilever refers to a type of wing structure that has no external bracing [cite: 419, 423], and stressed skin is a construction method used in both wings and fuselages, particularly in monocoque designs[cite: 180]."

      "a": "Conventional",
      "b": "Tricycle",
      "c": "Tandem"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "A conventional landing gear configuration is defined as having a tail wheel[cite: 69, 70]. A tricycle gear has a nose wheel[cite: 153, 154], and tandem gear, though not detailed, implies wheels in a fore-and-aft arrangement."

    "options": {
      "a": "Increase lift",
      "b": "Increase drag",
      "c": "Increase the takeoff run"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Trailing edge flaps are used to increase lift and drag, which allows for slower takeoff and landing speeds, thus shortening the takeoff and landing run[cite: 73, 74, 75, 474, 476]. Increasing the takeoff run would be undesirable."

      "a": "snow",
      "b": "land",
      "c": "water and land"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The document explicitly states that skis are for landing on snow[cite: 77, 78]. Wheels are used for land, and floats or a boat-like hull are used for water. An aircraft that can land on both water and land is called an amphibian[cite: 28, 458]."

      "a": "Aileron",
      "b": "Elevator",
      "c": "Leading edge slat"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Leading edge slats are high-lift devices specifically designed to reduce stalling speed and increase lift at lower airspeeds[cite: 81, 84]. Ailerons control roll, and elevators control pitch; they are primary control surfaces, not high-lift devices[cite: 82, 83]."

      "b": "Elevator",
      "c": "Aileron"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The elevator is the movable control surface responsible for creating a pitching movement, which rotates the aircraft about its lateral axis[cite: 85, 87, 96]. The rudder controls yaw (movement about the vertical axis), and ailerons control roll (movement about the longitudinal axis)[cite: 86, 88]."

      "b": "Bulkheads",
      "c": "Longerons"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Bulkheads are identified as the heaviest vertical structural members of the fuselage[cite: 89, 92]. Formers also provide shape but are lighter. Longerons are the primary lengthwise members, not vertical ones[cite: 93]."

      "b": "Elevator",
      "c": "Rudder"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The elevator is the control surface that rotates the airplane about the lateral axis, causing it to pitch up or down[cite: 94, 96]. Ailerons rotate the aircraft about the longitudinal axis (roll), and the rudder rotates it about the vertical axis (yaw)[cite: 95, 97]."

      "b": "Pratt truss type",
      "c": "Monocoque type"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The document specifies that a Warren truss is known for not having vertical members, connecting longerons with only diagonals. A Pratt truss uses longerons, vertical members, and diagonals. Monocoque is a different type of construction that relies on the skin for strength, not a truss framework."

  {
    "question_number": 22,
    "question": "What is a primary purpose of wing ribs?",
    "options": {
      "a": "To give shape to the wing and transmit stress",
      "b": "To carry the primary bending loads",
      "c": "To serve as an attachment point for the engine"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The document states that the purpose of ribs is to give shape to the wing and transmit stress from the skin to the spar. Carrying the primary bending loads is the function of the spar. The wing spar, not the ribs, typically serves as the attachment point for the engine."

    "options": {
      "a": "Torsion",
      "b": "Tension",
      "c": "Shear"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The document lists torsion (a twisting stress) and bending as combinational stresses. Bending is explicitly defined as a combination of tension and compression. Tension and shear are listed as primary, fundamental stress types, not combinations."

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "In the standard ATA zoning system, the first digit represents the major zone, the second represents the zone, and the third digit represents the subzone. Therefore, the '4' in 342 is the subzone number."

      "c": "Heavier than air & rotary wing aircraft"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A glider is an aircraft that generates lift through the dynamic reaction of air against its lifting surfaces (wings) and does not have an engine, making it heavier than air and a fixed-wing aircraft. It is not lighter than air (which uses buoyancy) or a rotary-wing aircraft (which uses rotors)."

      "a": "Aileron",
      "b": "Ruddervator",
      "c": "Flaperon"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A ruddervator combines the function of a rudder (yaw control) and an elevator (pitch control). This is the control surface used on V-tail aircraft, where the two tail surfaces perform both functions."

    "question_number": 94,
    "question": "Which of the following flight control surfaces is not a high-lift device?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Spoiler",
      "b": "Leading-edge slats",
      "c": "Trailing-edge flap"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Spoilers are used to decrease lift and increase drag, primarily for roll control or to act as air brakes during landing. Leading-edge slats and trailing-edge flaps are both high-lift devices used to increase lift at low airspeeds."

    "question": "Which problem is associated with tricycle landing gear?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Ground looping",
      "b": "Nosing over",
      "c": "Difficulty operating from rough fields"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "While tricycle gear is more stable on paved surfaces, the smaller nose wheel can dig into soft or rough fields, making it more difficult to operate in those conditions compared to the larger main wheels and tailwheel of a conventional gear aircraft. Ground looping and nosing over are problems associated with conventional gear."

  {
    "question_number": 102,
    "question": "One of the following is not a purpose of trailing edge flaps:",
    "options": {
      "a": "Increase lift",
      "b": "Reduce the landing roll",
      "c": "Increase the takeoff run"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Flaps increase lift and drag, which allows for slower takeoff and landing speeds. This shortens, not increases, the required takeoff and landing run. Reducing the landing roll is a direct benefit of the increased drag from the flaps."
