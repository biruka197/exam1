        "c": "PSID",
        "d": "inHg"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The Pascal (Pa) is the standard international (SI) unit for pressure. 'Bar' is a common metric unit but not the primary SI unit. 'PSID' (Pounds per Square Inch Differential) and 'inHg' (inches of Mercury) are non-SI, imperial units."

        "a": "Compressed gas",
        "b": "Vacuum",
        "c": "Oil",
        "d": "Mercury"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "An aneroid capsule is evacuated to a near-perfect vacuum, allowing its flexible walls to expand and contract solely based on external atmospheric pressure. It does not contain compressed gas, oil, or mercury, as these would interfere with its function."

      "question": "Which type of pressure sensor is best for differential measurements?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Capsule",
        "b": "Diaphragm",
        "c": "Bourdon tube",
        "d": "Manometer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A capsule, typically made of two diaphragms joined together, is specifically designed for differential measurements by allowing different pressures to be applied to its interior and exterior. While a diaphragm can measure differential pressure, a capsule assembly is purpose-built for it. Bourdon tubes and manometers are typically used for gauge pressure."

        "c": "Differential pressure",
        "d": "Dynamic pressure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Gauge pressure is, by definition, the pressure measured relative to the local atmospheric pressure. Static pressure is the ambient air pressure, differential pressure is the difference between any two points, and dynamic pressure is due to motion."

      "options": {
        "a": "Manual readings",
        "b": "Remote readings",
        "c": "Backup systems",
        "d": "Fuel lines"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The primary advantage of electrically operated sensors is their ability to transmit a pressure reading as an electrical signal over long distances to a cockpit display, enabling remote readings. Manual readings are done locally. While they can be used in backup systems or fuel lines, their main purpose is remote indication."

        "c": "Piezoresistor",
        "d": "Bellows"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Bellows are a purely mechanical pressure-sensing element. While they can be the input to a transducer in an electrical system, they are not themselves electrical. Autosyn, Selsyn, and piezoresistors are all electrical components used for transmitting or sensing pressure information."

        "a": "Multi-engine",
        "b": "Turboprop",
        "c": "Light single-engine",
        "d": "Jet"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Light single-engine aircraft often use simple, direct-reading gauges because the distance from the engine to the panel is short. Larger, more complex aircraft (multi-engine, turboprop, jet) use remote-sensing systems to avoid running long, potentially hazardous fluid lines into the cockpit."

      "question": "What is the risk with direct pressure reading systems?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Low accuracy",
        "b": "Electrical failure",
        "c": "Fluid leakage",
        "d": "Radio interference"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The main risk of a direct reading system is that it requires routing a line of pressurized fluid (like oil or fuel) into the cockpit, which poses a hazard of fluid leakage. These systems are mechanical, so low accuracy, electrical failure, and radio interference are not the primary concerns."

      "question": "Why is remote sensing used in fuel pressure indication?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Easier to calibrate",
        "b": "To avoid cockpit fuel lines",
        "c": "Cost-effective",
        "d": "Simpler gauges"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The paramount reason for using remote sensing for fuel pressure is safety, specifically to avoid running a line of flammable fuel into the cockpit. Other factors like calibration, cost, and complexity are secondary to this critical safety consideration."

      "question": "What does a capsule consist of?",
      "options": {
        "a": "One diaphragm",
        "b": "Two joined diaphragms",
        "c": "A coil",
        "d": "A piston"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "A pressure-sensing capsule is constructed by joining two corrugated diaphragms back-to-back around their peripheries. This creates a sealed chamber that can expand or contract with pressure changes. It does not consist of a single diaphragm, a coil, or a piston."

        "b": "Multiple bourdon tubes",
        "c": "Several diaphragms",
        "d": "Solid-state sensors"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Bellows are essentially a stack of several diaphragms joined together, creating a corrugated, accordion-like tube that is very sensitive to pressure changes along its axis. They are not combinations of tubes, springs, Bourdon tubes, or solid-state sensors."

      "question": "A solid-state pressure sensor produces output by:",
      "options": {
        "a": "Fluid displacement",
        "b": "Mechanical linkage",
        "c": "Varying electrical resistance",
        "d": "Changing pressure directly"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Solid-state pressure sensors, often using piezoresistive elements, work by detecting the physical strain on a diaphragm, which in turn causes a change in electrical resistance. They do not rely on fluid displacement or mechanical linkages for their primary output."

      "question": "Which of the following uses fluid-filled tubes and dials?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Bourdon tube",
        "b": "Capsule",
        "c": "Piezoresistor",
        "d": "Transducer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The Bourdon tube is a classic mechanical gauge that uses a tube filled with the system fluid; as pressure changes, the tube flexes and moves a pointer on a dial. Capsules, piezoresistors, and transducers are typically not fluid-filled in this manner."

      "question": "Which instrument is commonly used in hydraulic systems for remote reading?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Capsule",
        "b": "Bellows",
        "c": "Bourdon tube",
        "d": "Float"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A Bourdon tube is often used as the sensing element connected to a transducer (like a synchro system) for remote indication of high-pressure systems like hydraulics. Capsules and bellows are for lower pressures, and a float is used for liquid level, not pressure."

      "question": "What type of sensor is used to indicate crew oxygen pressure in the cockpit?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Float gauge",
        "b": "Solid-state transducer",
        "c": "Selsyn system",
        "d": "Liquid column"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Modern aircraft use a solid-state transducer to safely and reliably measure high-pressure crew oxygen and convert it to an electrical signal for the cockpit display. A float gauge is for liquid level, a Selsyn system is an older remote-reading technology, and a liquid column is impractical for this application."

        "c": "Diaphragms",
        "d": "Springs"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "A traditional mercury barometer reads atmospheric pressure by balancing it against the height of a fluid column (mercury). While aneroid barometers use diaphragms (option C), the general term 'barometer' often refers to the original fluid-based instrument."

        "c": "Bourdon tube",
        "d": "Autosyn"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A diaphragm is well-suited for measuring a pressure difference (differential pressure) across an orifice, such as in a flow meter. Bellows can also be used, but diaphragms are common. A Bourdon tube is for high gauge pressure, and an Autosyn is a signal transmission device, not a primary sensor."

        "c": "Bimetallic strip",
        "d": "Magnet"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A bimetallic strip, composed of two metals with different thermal expansion rates, can be incorporated into a mechanical pressure gauge's linkage to compensate for temperature-induced errors by flexing in the opposite direction of the error. Thermocouples and resistance bulbs measure temperature, and a magnet is not used for this purpose."

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Suction is the common term for gauge pressure that is below the local atmospheric pressure. It is also sometimes called vacuum or negative pressure (relative to atmospheric). Absolute pressure is referenced to a perfect vacuum, and differential pressure is the difference between two pressures."

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The static pressure system is extremely sensitive to leaks because it provides the reference pressure for the altimeter, VSI, and airspeed indicator. A leak would provide a false atmospheric reference, leading to erroneous readings on all three instruments. Pneumatic, hydraulic, and oxygen systems are less sensitive to minor atmospheric leaks."

      "options": {
        "a": "It is easier to read",
        "b": "Airspeed is linear",
        "c": "Pressure varies as square of velocity",
        "d": "It eliminates static error"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Dynamic pressure is proportional to the square of the airspeed (V²). This means the instrument's internal mechanism must incorporate a 'square-law' compensation (often a cam or eccentric linkage) to create a more linear and readable scale, especially at lower airspeeds where pressure changes are very small."

      "options": {
        "a": "Incorrect heading",

        "d": "Overheating of ADC"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Position error introduces a false static pressure reference. Since both the altimeter and airspeed indicator rely on this static pressure for their calculations, both instruments will display incorrect readings. This error does not affect heading, fuel balance, or the ADC's temperature."
