      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The speed of sound is dependent on temperature, which generally decreases with altitude. Therefore, a certain True Airspeed represents a higher Mach number at high altitude than at sea level. This could cause the aircraft to exceed its critical Mach number (Mcrit), leading to dangerous aerodynamic effects like shockwaves."

        "d": "A restricted passage or metering unit"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "A conventional VSI uses a calibrated leak, also known as a restricted passage, capillary, or metering unit, to allow static pressure to slowly enter or exit the instrument case. This creates a time lag and a pressure differential between the case and the diaphragm, which is proportional to the rate of climb or descent."

        "d": "It is more accurate at very high altitudes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The IVSI reduces the inherent time lag of a conventional VSI by incorporating a dashpot piston mechanism, which is essentially an accelerometer. This provides a more immediate indication of vertical speed changes."

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In digital systems like those with an Air Data Computer (ADC), the rate of climb is calculated by a computer. It uses a pressure sensor to measure the change in static pressure over a precise time interval measured by a digital clock, replacing the need for a mechanical calibrated orifice."
