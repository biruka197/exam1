        "question": "Which of the following is false about flexible cables?",
        "options": {
            "A": "7 strands and 7 wires",
            "B": "Should not be used where flexing requirements are extreme",
            "C": "They are used for trim tabs"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This statement is poorly phrased but the intended false statement. Flexible (7x7) cable is used for moderate flexing. While it's true that extra-flexible (7x19) cable is used for extreme flexing, the absolute nature of the statement makes it the most likely incorrect option in a multiple choice test."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A hand-woven splice around a thimble, known as a thimble-eye terminal, is rated to retain approximately 75% of the original cable's breaking strength."

        "question_number": 42,
        "question": "In the cockpit, the pilot pushes the control column forward and to the left, the right aileron",
        "options": {
            "A": "Moves upward and elevator downward",
            "B": "Moves upward and elevator upward",
            "C": "Moves downward and elevator downward"
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Pushing the control column forward moves the elevator downward. Pushing the column to the left moves the left aileron up and the right aileron down. Therefore, the right aileron moves downward and the elevator moves downward."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A rigging fixture is a special tool, often custom-built for a specific aircraft model, designed to hold a component in the correct position or to check a specific angle like dihedral."

        "question_number": 44,
        "question": "Which of the following aircraft conditions is done during dihedral adjustment?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The aircraft will be in flight position & using dihedral board",
            "B": "The aircraft will be in level position & using dihedral board",
            "C": "Using dihedral board and string adjustment"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To accurately check or adjust the dihedral angle, the aircraft must first be placed in a level flight attitude (leveled longitudinally and laterally). Then, a dihedral board and level are used to measure the wing angle."

            "C": "Center head protractor"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A universal propeller protractor is a precision instrument specifically designed for accurately measuring angles, making it the standard tool for measuring control surface travel in degrees."

            "C": "Upward position"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When measuring control surface travel, the measurement begins from the neutral or faired position, which serves as the zero-degree reference point."

        "question": "Which one of the following is the main objective of rigging control surface?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To obtain correct cable tension",
            "B": "To provide synchronization between control surfaces and control column",

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The main objectives of rigging include obtaining the correct cable tension for proper feel, and ensuring the control surfaces are synchronized and travel through their correct range relative to cockpit inputs."

            "B": "Adjust cable tension as necessary"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a typical rigging sequence, the control surface travel range is set first using stops or pushrod adjustments. After the travel is confirmed to be correct, the cable tension is adjusted to specification."
