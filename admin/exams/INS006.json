      "a": "Absolute",
      "b": "Differential",
      "c": "Gage"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Differential**[cite: 6]. This question is interpreted to mean a standard, fixed reference.Differential pressure measures the difference between two arbitrary pressure points, neither of which is a fixed reference[cite: 9, 10].**Absolute pressure** is incorrect because it is measured relative to a perfect vacuum (absolute zero pressure), which is a fixed reference[cite: 5].**Gage pressure** is incorrect because it is measured relative to the local atmospheric pressure, which serves as its reference[cite: 7]."

      "a": "Differential",
      "b": "Gage",
      "c": "Absolute"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Differential**[cite: 11].This is the definition of differential pressure, as it compares two distinct pressures[cite: 9, 10].**Gage pressure** is incorrect because it measures pressure relative to the surrounding atmospheric pressure[cite: 12].**Absolute pressure** is incorrect because it measures pressure relative to a perfect vacuum[cite: 13]."

    "question": "Which of the following is correct about bourdon tube?",
    "options": {
      "a": "When high pressures need to be measured, the tube is designed to be stiff",
      "b": "When low pressures need to be measured, the tube is designed to be stiff",
      "c": "capsules are more stiff than bourdon tube"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **a**[cite: 15]. To withstand high pressures without deforming or rupturing, a Bourdon tube must be made from stronger, thicker, and therefore stiffer material. **Option b** is incorrect because a less stiff, more flexible tube is required to provide the necessary sensitivity for low-pressure measurements. **Option c** is incorrect because capsules are generally used for measuring lower pressures and are less stiff than Bourdon tubes, especially those designed for high-pressure applications."

    "question_number": 4,
    "question": "Which of the following is correct about Magnesyn?",
    "options": {
      "a": "It uses permanent magnet for its rotors",
      "b": "It uses DC current as input",
      "c": "It uses electromagnet for its rotors"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **a**[cite: 19]. The Magnesyn remote indicating system is characterized by its use of a permanent magnet rotor. **Option b** is incorrect because Magnesyn systems operate on AC power to create the rotating magnetic fields in the stator.**Option c** is incorrect because it is the Autosyn system, another type of AC synchro, that utilizes an electromagnet for its rotor[cite: 21]."

  {
    "question_number": 5,
    "question": "Why is remote indication system preferred for Fuel Pressure Indication System?",
    "options": {
      "a": "It is not safe to run a fuel line into the cockpit",
      "b": "To reduce magnetic interference",
      "c": "To reduce radio interference"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **a**[cite: 23]. The primary reason for using a remote indication system for fuel pressure is safety. Running a line containing flammable fuel into the cockpit would create a serious fire hazard. A remote system keeps the fuel lines and sensor in or near the engine bay, sending only electrical signals to the cockpit indicator. **Options b and c** are incorrect because while reducing magnetic or radio interference is a general goal in aircraft design, it is not the principal safety reason for using remote indication for flammable fluids."

    "question": "At what cabin altitude will a cabin altitude warning switch close?",
    "options": {
      "a": "10,000 ft. above mean sea level",
      "b": "9,500 ft. above mean sea level",
      "c": "15,000 ft. above mean sea level"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **10,000 ft. above mean sea level**[cite: 27]. Aviation regulations require an aural or visual warning to alert the flight crew if the cabin pressure altitude exceeds 10,000 feet. This altitude is considered the upper limit for most people before the risk of hypoxia becomes significant. The other altitudes are incorrect regulatory standards for this specific warning."

  {
    "question_number": 7,
    "question": "Which type of sensor is most suited for differential pressure measurement?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Diaphragms",
      "b": "Bellows",
      "c": "Bourdon tube"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Diaphragms**[cite: 31]. Diaphragms and Bellows are both well-suited for measuring differential pressure because pressure can be applied to both sides of the sensor. A diaphragm is a flexible membrane that deflects in proportion to the pressure difference across it. **Bellows** also work but are essentially a stack of diaphragms. **Bourdon tubes** are typically used for measuring gauge pressure (pressure relative to the case) and are not easily adapted for differential pressure sensing across two ports."

    "question": "_______ is a pressures being interpreted as power available at the engine propeller shaft.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Torque Pressure",
      "b": "Control pressure",
      "c": "Manifold pressure"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Manifold pressure**[cite: 37]. In a reciprocating (piston) engine, manifold pressure is the absolute pressure in the intake manifold. It indicates the amount of fuel-air mixture going into the cylinders and is used by the pilot as the primary measure of engine power. **Torque Pressure** is the primary indication of power in a turboprop engine, not a piston engine. **Control pressure** is a generic term for pressure within a hydraulic or pneumatic control system."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 9,
    "question": "Which of the following is correct?",
    "options": {
      "a": "The higher the pressure of the fuel air mixture going into the engine, the less power it can produce",
      "b": "The higher the pressure of the fuel air mixture going into the engine, the more power it can produce",
      "c": "The lower the pressure of the fuel air mixture going into the engine, the more power it can produce"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **b**[cite: 40]. A higher pressure (i.e., higher manifold pressure) means a denser charge of the fuel-air mixture is forced into the engine's cylinders. A denser charge contains more oxygen molecules, allowing more fuel to be combusted, which in turn produces more power. **Options a and c** are incorrect as they state the opposite of this principle."

    "options": {
      "a": "Bourdon tube",
      "b": "Diaphragm",
      "c": "Capsule"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Bourdon tube**[cite: 43]. Aircraft hydraulic systems operate at very high pressures (e.g., 3000 PSI). The Bourdon tube is a robust, simple mechanical sensor well-suited for measuring such high pressures.**Diaphragms** [cite: 44]and **Capsules** [cite: 45] are typically used for measuring much lower pressures and would not be suitable for a high-pressure hydraulic system."

      "b": "Desynn",
      "c": "Magnasyn"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Autosyn**[cite: 49]. The Autosyn system is a type of AC remote-indicating system that uses an energized two-pole electromagnet as its rotor.**Magnasyn** is incorrect as it uses a permanent magnet rotor[cite: 51].**Desynn** is incorrect as it is a DC system that typically uses a permanent magnet rotor[cite: 50]."

      "a": "Flange mounting",
      "b": "Clamp-flange mounting",
      "c": "Clamp mounting"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Flange mounting**[cite: 53]. This is a definitional question. An instrument designed with an integrated rim or border (a flange) with screw holes is intended for flange mounting, where it is attached to the front of the instrument panel.**Clamp mounting** secures an instrument from the rear via a separate clamp[cite: 55]."

      "b": "Gyro-horizon, standby magnetic compass",
      "c": "Vertical speed indicator, Gyro-horizon"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **c**[cite: 59]. The standard 'basic six' or 'six pack' layout of flight instruments includes the Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI) and the Attitude Indicator (or Gyro-horizon). The **standby magnetic compass** is a required instrument but is physically separate and not considered part of this primary instrument cluster."

      "c": "Torque synchro"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Micro-desynn**[cite: 62]. Desynn systems are a class of remote-indicating instruments that operate on direct current (DC).**Torque synchro** [cite: 63]and **Control synchro** [cite: 61] are types of AC synchro systems, which operate on alternating current."

      "b": "Air speed indicator, standby magnetic compass",
      "c": "Altimeter, course indicator"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **c**[cite: 67]. The basic six flight instruments include the Altimeter and the Course Indicator (often part of a Horizontal Situation Indicator, HSI).As with question 13, the **standby magnetic compass** is not part of this core grouping[cite: 65, 66]."

  {
    "question_number": 16,
    "question": "How does the stator of a TX (Transmitter) of a synchro receive voltage?",
    "options": {
      "a": "By a magnetic coupling with the rotor",
      "b": "By a physical connection with the rotor",
      "c": "By a magnetic coupling with another stator"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **a**[cite: 69]. In a synchro transmitter, an AC voltage is applied to the rotor, which creates a magnetic field. This magnetic field induces voltages in the three Y-connected stator windings via transformer action (magnetic coupling). The voltage induced in each stator winding depends on its angular position relative to the rotor's magnetic field.There is no physical electrical connection between the rotor and stator windings[cite: 70]."

      "b": "Primary flight display",
      "c": "Engine tachometer"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Engine tachometer**[cite: 75]. The 1903 Wright Flyer had extremely limited instrumentation which included a stopwatch, an anemometer (for airspeed), and an engine tachometer to monitor engine revolutions per minute (RPM).**Gyro horizon** [cite: 73]and **Primary flight display** [cite: 74] are much more advanced instruments that were invented decades later."

      "b": "Flange mounting",
      "c": "Flange and Clamp mounting"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **c** because both Flange and Clamp mounting are common methods used to install aircraft instruments[cite: 79].**Flange mounting** involves securing the instrument from the front using a built-in flange[cite: 78].**Clamp mounting** involves securing a cylindrical instrument from behind the panel using a clamp[cite: 77]. Since both are used, this is the most complete answer."

      "b": "Power plant instruments",
      "c": "Flight instruments"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Power plant instruments**[cite: 82]. This is the correct categorical term for instruments that monitor the engine, such as tachometers, pressure gauges, and temperature gauges.**Flight instruments** provide information about the aircraft's attitude, airspeed, and altitude[cite: 83].**Navigation instruments** provide guidance information for flying a course[cite: 81]."

      "b": "Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System",
      "c": "Altimeter"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Horizontal situation display** (HSD or HSI)[cite: 85]. The HSI is a primary navigation instrument that combines heading information with course deviation from VOR or GPS, allowing the pilot to visualize and follow a selected course.The **Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS)** displays engine parameters[cite: 86].The **Altimeter** displays altitude[cite: 87]."

      "c": "At the center of the forward instrument panel visible to both pilots"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **c**[cite: 91]. Because engine parameters are critical for flight safety and must be monitored by both pilots, the power plant instruments are typically located in the center of the main instrument panel, ensuring they are clearly visible from both the Captain's and First Officer's seats."

      "b": "Red radial line",
      "c": "Yellow arc"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **White arc**[cite: 95]. On an airspeed indicator, the white arc denotes the full flap operating range. The bottom of the arc is the flaps-down, power-off stall speed (Vso), and the top of the arc is the maximum flap extended speed (Vfe).The **Yellow arc** is the caution range for smooth air only[cite: 97].The **Red radial line** is the never-exceed speed (Vne)[cite: 96]."

      "c": "Transmitter and receiver"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Transmitter and receiver**[cite: 105]. A synchro *system* is comprised of a transmitter (TX) that converts a mechanical angle into an electrical signal, and a receiver (TR) that converts that signal back into a mechanical angle at a remote location.While **Rotor** [cite: 103][cite_start], **Shaft** [cite: 103][cite_start], **Housing** [cite: 104][cite_start], and **Stator** [cite: 104] are physical parts of a synchro, the primary functional components of the entire system are the transmitter and receiver."

      "b": "Contact instrument system",
      "c": "Remote sensing instrument system"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Direct sensing instrument system**[cite: 107]. This type of instrument is self-contained, with the sensing, measuring, and indicating mechanisms all housed in one unit on the instrument panel. A simple pressure gauge is a good example.A **Remote sensing instrument system** is the opposite, with the sensor located elsewhere and connected electrically to the cockpit indicator[cite: 109]."

      "c": "Measuring element"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "The correct answer is **Detecting element**[cite: 121].The detecting (or sensing) element is the component that directly interacts with the physical quantity being measured, such as a diaphragm for pressure or a bimetallic strip for temperature[cite: 118, 119]. The **Measuring element** translates the sensor's response into a usable value, and the **Coupling element** links the measuring element to the indicator."
