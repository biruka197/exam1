      "a": "fuselage",
      "b": "landing gear",
      "c": "wing"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The landing gear's primary function is to support the aircraft during takeoff, landing, and ground operations. During flight, it is typically retracted and does not bear the aerodynamic loads. In contrast, the fuselage (the aircraft's body) and the wings are primary structures that constantly manage significant aerodynamic forces and stresses throughout the flight. ‚úàÔ∏è"

    "question": "Which control surface rotates the airplane about the vertical axis?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Aileron",
      "b": "Elevator",
      "c": "Rudder"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The rudder is the control surface, typically on the vertical tail fin, that controls yaw, which is the side-to-side rotation of the aircraft's nose about its vertical axis. The ailerons control roll (rotation about the longitudinal axis), and the elevator controls pitch (rotation about the lateral axis)."

    "question": "Which one of the following machines is designed to be supported in the air by the dynamic reaction of the air?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Airship",
      "b": "Glider",
      "c": "Balloon"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A glider is a heavier-than-air craft that generates lift through the dynamic reaction of air moving over its airfoil-shaped wings. An airship and a balloon are lighter-than-air craft that are supported by the principle of buoyancy, floating in the air because they are filled with a gas less dense than the air they displace. üéà"

    "question_number": 4,
    "question": "Which one of the following is lifted by the buoyancy principle?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Glider",
      "b": "Airship",
      "c": "Aircraft"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "An airship operates on the principle of buoyancy. It is filled with a lifting gas (like helium) that is less dense than the surrounding air, causing it to float. A glider and a conventional aircraft are heavier than air and depend on aerodynamic lift generated by their wings as they move through the air."

    "options": {
      "a": "Airplane",
      "b": "Airship",
      "c": "Balloon"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The term 'airframe' specifically refers to the mechanical structure of a heavier-than-air craft like an airplane, which includes the fuselage, wings, undercarriage, and empennage (tail). It does not include the propulsion system. The structures of an airship or balloon are typically referred to as the envelope or hull."

  {
    "question_number": 6,
    "question": "Which one of the following is a combined stress?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Compression",
      "b": "Tension",
      "c": "Bending of wing"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Bending, such as that experienced by a wing in flight, is a combined stress. It simultaneously creates tension (a stretching force) on the upper surface of the wing and compression (a squeezing force) on the lower surface. Tension and compression, by themselves, are fundamental or simple stresses, not combined ones."

    "question": "What are the primary longitudinal structural members of a fuselage called?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Formers",
      "b": "Stringers",
      "c": "Longerons"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Longerons are the main structural beams that run along the length of the fuselage, providing its primary bending strength. Formers are the circular or oval frames that give the fuselage its shape, while stringers are smaller longitudinal members that add stiffness to the aircraft's skin."

    "options": {
      "a": "To determine the aircraft's resale value",
      "b": "To ensure the aircraft is airworthy",
      "c": "To schedule routine cleaning"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The fundamental purpose of any aircraft inspection program is to ensure the aircraft is airworthy, meaning it is safe for flight and conforms to its type certificate. While inspections can affect resale value and might be scheduled alongside cleaning, safety and regulatory compliance are the main goals. ‚úÖ"

    "question_number": 9,
    "question": "How are entry doors on large, pressurized aircraft typically designed to prevent accidental opening in flight?",
    "options": {
      "a": "They use multiple complex latches",
      "b": "They open inwards first",
      "c": "They can only be opened from the outside"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "These doors are 'plug doors.' They open inwards slightly and are larger than the door frame. The higher internal cabin pressure pushes the door securely against the frame, creating a tight seal that prevents it from opening in flight. While multiple latches are also used, the plug design is the key passive safety feature."

    "question_number": 10,
    "question": "What is the general term for a main door used by both crew and passengers for boarding and deplaning?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Service door",
      "b": "Cargo door",
      "c": "Passenger entry door"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "A passenger entry door is the primary means of entry and exit for both passengers and the flight/cabin crew. Service doors are typically used for catering and ground support, while cargo doors are used for loading freight and baggage. üö™"

    "question": "In a cargo area, what is installed to allow freight to be loaded easily?",
    "options": {
      "a": "A plastic mat",
      "b": "A ball-mat",
      "c": "Carpet"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A ball-mat, or ball transfer floor, consists of multiple freely rotating balls that allow heavy cargo containers (ULDs) to be moved and positioned with minimal friction. Carpet or a simple plastic mat would not facilitate the easy movement of heavy freight."

    "question_number": 12,
    "question": "What is the critical first step when performing a wing installation?",
    "options": {
      "a": "To tighten all the bolts",
      "b": "To support the wing correctly",
      "c": "To connect the fuel lines"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Before any attachments are made, the wing must be correctly supported and aligned with the fuselage using specialized jigs and supports. This prevents stress and damage to the attachment points. Tightening bolts and connecting fuel lines are later steps that can only occur once the wing is securely and accurately positioned."

  {
    "question_number": 13,
    "question": "What is the name for a construction method where the outer skin carries all the structural loads?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Semi-monocoque",
      "b": "Monocoque",
      "c": "Truss"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Monocoque (from Greek for 'single shell') construction uses the skin to bear the primary structural loads. Semi-monocoque, which is more common in modern aircraft, uses a skin that is reinforced by an internal framework of formers and stringers. A truss structure uses an internal frame to carry all loads, with the skin acting only as a cover."

    "question": "On which official FAA form are major repairs and major alterations to an aircraft recorded?",
    "options": {
      "a": "FAA Form 8130-3",
      "b": "FAA Form 337",
      "c": "The aircraft logbook only"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "An FAA Form 337, titled 'Major Repair and Alteration,' is the specific document required for detailing such work. While a corresponding entry is made in the aircraft logbook, Form 337 provides the official, detailed record. FAA Form 8130-3 is an Airworthiness Approval Tag, typically for components."

    "question_number": 15,
    "question": "To be considered airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its:",
    "options": {
      "a": "Production certificate",
      "b": "Type certificate",
      "c": "Registration certificate"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "An aircraft is airworthy when it conforms to its Type Certificate (TC) and is in a condition for safe operation. The TC is the FAA's approval of the aircraft's design. The production certificate allows its manufacture, and the registration certificate proves ownership, but airworthiness is fundamentally tied to the TC."

    "question": "What is the term for a control surface that combines the functions of both the rudder and the elevator?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Aileron",
      "b": "Flaperon",
      "c": "Ruddervator"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "A ruddervator, found on V-tail aircraft, is a control surface that moves simultaneously to control pitch (like an elevator) and differentially to control yaw (like a rudder). A flaperon combines the function of a flap and an aileron, while an aileron controls roll."

    "options": {
      "a": "Airworthiness Certificate",
      "b": "Maintenance Manual",
      "c": "Type Certificate"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The Type Certificate (TC) is the foundational document issued by a regulatory body that certifies that an aircraft design meets all required airworthiness standards. The Airworthiness Certificate is issued to a single, specific aircraft, and the Maintenance Manual provides instructions for upkeep."

  {
    "question_number": 19,
    "question": "The design philosophy that incorporates redundant systems to ensure a failure does not lead to a catastrophe is known as:",
    "options": {
      "a": "Monocoque design",
      "b": "Fail-safe design",
      "c": "Aerodynamic design"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Fail-safe design is a core principle in aerospace engineering that uses redundancy‚Äîmultiple systems or structural load paths‚Äîto ensure that the failure of one part does not lead to the total failure of the aircraft. The other options are structural or performance-related design types, not overarching safety philosophies."

      "b": "Fuselage",
      "c": "Engine"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "An aircraft is composed of the airframe, the powerplant, and systems. The engine is the main component of the powerplant, which provides thrust. The airframe comprises the structural elements like the wings and fuselage. ‚öôÔ∏è"

    "question": "What material is commonly used for aircraft cabin windows?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Tempered glass",
      "b": "Polycarbonate",
      "c": "Stretched acrylic plastic"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Stretched acrylic plastic is the standard material for cabin windows due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, excellent optical clarity, and resistance to shattering and crazing (fine cracks). Tempered glass is much heavier, and polycarbonate, while strong, is more susceptible to scratching."

  {
    "question_number": 22,
    "question": "What is the fundamental difference in how a fixed-wing aircraft and a rotary-wing aircraft (helicopter) generate lift?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Fixed-wing uses wings; rotary-wing uses buoyancy.",
      "b": "Fixed-wing uses forward motion over stationary wings; rotary-wing uses engine-driven rotating airfoils.",
      "c": "There is no fundamental difference."
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A fixed-wing aircraft must move forward through the air for its stationary wings to generate lift. In contrast, a rotary-wing aircraft uses its engine to spin its rotor blades (rotating airfoils), which generate lift even when the aircraft is hovering. Buoyancy is the lifting principle for airships, not helicopters. üöÅ"

    "question_number": 23,
    "question": "Which structural components are primarily responsible for giving a fuselage its cross-sectional shape?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Longerons",
      "b": "Stringers",
      "c": "Formers"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Formers, also known as bulkheads or frames, are the transverse structural rings that give the fuselage its round or oval cross-sectional shape. Longerons and stringers are longitudinal members that run along the length of the fuselage for strength, following the contour set by the formers."

    "question_number": 25,
    "question": "Which of the following is considered a secondary flight control surface, not a primary one?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Ailerons",
      "b": "Elevator",
      "c": "Flaps"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Flaps are secondary flight controls used to increase lift and drag, primarily during slow-speed flight for takeoff and landing. The primary flight controls are those essential for maneuvering the aircraft about its three axes: ailerons (roll), elevator (pitch), and rudder (yaw)."
