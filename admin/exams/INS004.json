    "question": "What are the three instruments that use gyroscopes?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Gyro horizon, directional gyro, airspeed",
      "b": "Gyro horizon, directional gyro, turn-and-bank",
      "c": "Rate of climb indicator, directional gyro, turn-and-bank"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "The Gyro horizon (Attitude Indicator), Directional Gyro (Heading Indicator), and Turn-and-Bank Indicator are the three common flight instruments that operate using a gyroscope[cite: 133]. The Airspeed Indicator and Rate of Climb Indicator are incorrect choices because they are pressure-driven instruments that work based on changes in air pressure, not gyroscopic principles."

    "question": "____ pumps use lubricating oil.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Wet",
      "b": "Dry",
      "c": "Centrifugal"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "In the context of vacuum systems for aircraft instruments, 'wet' pumps are a type that uses engine oil for lubrication and to create a seal within the pump[cite: 136]. 'Dry' pumps are incorrect as they use self-lubricating carbon vanes and do not circulate oil. 'Centrifugal' describes a type of pump action, not its method of lubrication."

    "question": "Which drive system produces high rotor speeds?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Pneumatic",
      "b": "Electric",
      "c": "Hydraulic"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "Electric motors are capable of spinning gyro rotors at very high and stable speeds (often exceeding 20,000 RPM), which enhances their rigidity in space[cite: 141]. Pneumatic (air-driven) systems are also common but generally produce lower speeds and can be less effective at high altitudes where the air is thinner. Hydraulic systems are not used to power instrument gyros."

    "question_number": 4,
    "question": "Angular change in plane of rotation of a gyro is called ________.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Precession",
      "b": "Veering",
      "c": "Rigidity"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "Precession is the term for the resultant action when a force is applied to a spinning gyro; the gyro reacts 90 degrees in the direction of rotation[cite: 144]. This principle is used to correct and erect gyros. 'Rigidity' (or rigidity in space) is the principle that a gyro resists changes to its plane of rotation, which is incorrect. 'Veering' is not a standard gyroscopic term."

    "question": "Gimbal error is more pronounced in _____ axis gyros.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Vertical",
      "b": "Horizontal",
      "c": "Lateral"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "Directional gyros, which have a horizontal spin axis, are more susceptible to errors like apparent drift caused by the Earth's rotation[cite: 149]. Attitude indicators use a vertical gyro, which is designed to align with the force of gravity and is less affected by these specific rotational errors. 'Lateral' is an axis on the aircraft, not a classification for a gyro in this context."

    "question_number": 6,
    "question": "What is gimbal lock?",
    "options": {
      "a": "The gimbal lock due to earthâ€™s magnetic attraction",
      "b": "Spin axis parallel to one of the other gimbal axes",
      "c": "Due to the rotor precession"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "Gimbal lock is a mechanical problem that occurs when two of a gyro's gimbal rings become aligned in the same plane, causing the instrument to lose a degree of freedom and tumble[cite: 153]. It is not caused by the Earth's magnetic attraction. While precession can cause the gimbals to move, it is the resulting alignment of the gimbals, not precession itself, that defines gimbal lock."

    "question_number": 7,
    "question": "The background sky in gyro horizons attached to its _______.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Outer gimbal",
      "b": "Inner gimbal",
      "c": "Gyro rotor"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The attitude indicator's display (the fixed sky and horizon background) is attached to the outer gimbal, which is fixed to the instrument case and moves with the aircraft[cite: 156]. The gyro and inner gimbal remain stabilized, and their movement relative to the outer gimbal and case is what shows the aircraft's pitch and roll."

    "question_number": 8,
    "question": "Which gyro technology is implemented inside a chip?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Pneumatic gyro",
      "b": "AHARS",
      "c": "MEMS"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
   "explanation": "MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) gyros are microscopic solid-state sensors fabricated onto a silicon chip[cite: 162]. They detect rotation using the Coriolis effect on a tiny vibrating structure. 'Pneumatic gyro' is incorrect as it refers to a traditional, mechanical air-driven gyro. 'AHRS' (Attitude and Heading Reference System) is a system that *uses* gyros (often MEMS), but it is the system itself, not the chip-level technology."

  {
    "question_number": 9,
    "question": "What is the purpose of erection systems?",
    "options": {
      "a": "To bring gyro axis vertical",
      "b": "To bring gyro axis horizontal",
      "c": "To bring gyro axis lateral"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "In an attitude indicator (gyro horizon), the erection system's purpose is to use the force of gravity to sense and correct for any precession or drift, ensuring the gyro's spin axis remains vertical (aligned with gravity)[cite: 164]. This provides an accurate artificial horizon. Maintaining a horizontal or lateral axis is the function of other types of gyros or is incorrect."

    "question_number": 10,
    "question": "Acceleration errors result is a false ______ reading.",
    "options": {
      "a": "roll",
      "b": "Pitch",
      "c": "Yaw"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "During linear acceleration or deceleration, the pendulous vanes of an attitude indicator's erection system can cause a false pitch-up or pitch-down indication[cite: 169]. This is because the system misinterprets the acceleration force as a gravity vector shift. Roll and yaw are not the primary axes affected by this specific error."

  {
    "question_number": 11,
    "question": "In pitch-bank compensation, ____ switch is disconnected during turn.",
    "options": {
      "a": "YAW",
      "b": "ROLL",
      "c": "PITCH"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "To prevent the attitude indicator from precessing and showing a false bank during a turn, a pitch-bank compensation system often disconnects or modifies the roll erection mechanism during the turn[cite: 173]. This stops the system from misinterpreting the combined forces of gravity and turning as an error that needs correction."

  {
    "question_number": 12,
    "question": "What component does a VG use to send roll/pitch data to indicator?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Synchro",
      "b": "Asynchro",
      "c": "Linear variable transformer"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "A Vertical Gyro (VG) often uses a synchro transmitter to convert the mechanical position of the gyro's gimbals (representing pitch and roll) into electrical signals[cite: 176]. These signals are then sent to a synchro receiver in the indicator, which replicates the position on the display. 'Asynchro' is not a standard term, and a 'Linear variable transformer' measures linear displacement, not the rotational data required for attitude."

  {
    "question_number": 13,
    "question": "If attitude sphere is out of tolerance but no flag is shown, the problem may be _______.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Gimbal effect",
      "b": "Horizontal gyro erection",
      "c": "VG erection"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "If the attitude display is inaccurate but the power failure flag is not visible, it suggests the gyro is spinning but is not being correctly aligned to the vertical.This points to a problem with the Vertical Gyro (VG) erection system, which is responsible for correcting errors and maintaining vertical alignment[cite: 182]."

    "question_number": 14,
    "question": "In a coordinated left turn the ball is _____.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Centered",
      "b": "Moves left side",
      "c": "Moves right side"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "In a coordinated turn, the forces of gravity and centrifugal force are balanced, causing the ball in the turn-and-bank indicator to remain in the center[cite: 184]. If the ball moves to the left (inside the turn), it indicates a slip. If it moves to the right (outside the turn), it indicates a skid."

  {
    "question_number": 15,
    "question": "___ is used to increase instrument sensitivity.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Pitch adjustment screw",
      "b": "Rate adjustment screw",
      "c": "Roll adjustment screw"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "A rate adjustment screw on a gyroscopic instrument, such as a turn coordinator, can be used during calibration to change how the instrument responds to a given rate of turn, effectively adjusting its sensitivity[cite: 189]. Pitch and roll adjustment screws are typically for zeroing the display, not changing the rate sensitivity."

    "question": "The air bleed hole size is adjustable. The statement is",
    "options": {
      "a": "True",
      "b": "False"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The statement is true[cite: 192]. In some gyro erection systems, the size of the air bleed holes or vents can be adjusted during maintenance or calibration to control the rate at which the gyro erects or corrects itself."

    "question_number": 17,
    "question": "Almost all current production aircraft are equipped with at least an attitude gyro and a gyroscopic heading indicator. The statement is",
    "options": {
      "a": "True",
      "b": "False"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The statement is true[cite: 196]. An attitude indicator and a heading indicator are fundamental for instrument flight and are standard equipment on virtually all modern aircraft, from small general aviation planes to large airliners, either as standalone instruments or integrated into an electronic flight display."

  {
    "question_number": 18,
    "question": "What is the advantages of a venturi as a suction source for the gyro operation?",
    "options": {
      "a": "low cost and simplicity of installation and operation",
      "b": "Low weight and volume",
      "c": "High speed and accuracy"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The primary advantages of using a venturi tube to create suction for pneumatic gyros are its low cost and extreme simplicity, as it has no moving parts[cite: 199]. However, it is not the most efficient or lightest option and is susceptible to icing, making other options incorrect."

  {
    "question_number": 19,
    "question": "Which of the following gyroscopic instruments suffer from the effects of a decrease in vacuum due to the lower atmospheric pressure?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Electric driven gyro",
      "b": "vacuum-driven",
      "c": "solid state gyro"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Vacuum-driven gyros rely on a pressure differential to spin.As an aircraft climbs, the ambient air pressure decreases, which can reduce the effectiveness of the vacuum system and slow the gyro's rotation speed if the system cannot compensate[cite: 204]. Electric and solid-state gyros are not affected by this, as their operation is independent of air pressure."

  {
    "question_number": 20,
    "question": "In order to bring the gyroscope to its normal operating position as quickly as possible, a_______ system is provided.",
    "options": {
      "a": "fast erection",
      "b": "inner gimbal",
      "c": "outer gimbal"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "A fast erection or caging system is used to quickly align a gyroscope to its correct position (e.g., vertical for an attitude indicator) upon startup, bypassing the much slower normal erection process[cite: 207]. The inner and outer gimbals are structural components of the gyro, not systems for alignment."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 21,
    "question": "What makes when an aircraft turns, false indications about the pitch and bank axes?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Due to atmospheric condition",
      "b": "Due to acceleration effect",
      "c": "due to 'gimballing effects'"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
   "explanation": "'Gimballing effects' and turning errors cause the erection system to sense the combined forces of the turn and gravity, leading it to precess the gyro and create false pitch and bank indications[cite: 213]. Acceleration effect typically refers to errors during linear acceleration, not turning. Atmospheric conditions do not directly cause this type of error."

  {
    "question_number": 22,
    "question": "The electrically driven gyro has full freedom in roll and It has -85 to +85 degrees freedom of pitch . The statement is",
    "options": {
      "a": "True",
      "b": "False"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
   "explanation": "The statement is true[cite: 216]. A typical electrically driven attitude indicator is designed to have full 360-degree freedom in the roll axis, while its pitch freedom is mechanically limited (e.g., to +/- 85 degrees) to prevent the gyro from tumbling at extreme pitch attitudes."

  {
    "question_number": 23,
    "question": "________ indicator is an electromechanical unit that converts the attitude signals coming from the vertical gyro in to the roll and pitch indications.",
    "options": {
      "a": "yaw",
      "b": "the attitude",
      "c": "turn and bank"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "The attitude indicator is the instrument that receives electrical signals (often from a remote vertical gyro) and converts them into a visual display of the aircraft's roll and pitch attitude[cite: 220]. A yaw damper uses yaw rate information, and a turn and bank indicator shows the rate of turn, making them incorrect."

  {
    "question_number": 24,
    "question": "What will be the probable cause if attitude sphere malfunctioning and gyro flag in view?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Vertical gyro inoperative or instrument amplifier failure",
      "b": "Horizontal gyro inoperative or instrument amplifier failure",
      "c": "Electrical power failure"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "A gyro flag indicates that the gyro is not up to speed or is unreliable.If the attitude sphere (which relies on the vertical gyro) is also malfunctioning, it points to a failure in the vertical gyro itself or the amplifier that processes its signals[cite: 223]. A power failure would also cause this, but the provided answer is more specific to the instrument's direct components. A horizontal gyro is used for the heading indicator, not the attitude indicator."

  {
    "question_number": 25,
    "question": "Which one of the following flight instrument is considered an essential primary 'blind flying' instrument?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Attitude gyro",
      "b": "turn-and-bank indicator",
      "c": "airspeed indicator"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
   "explanation": "The turn-and-bank indicator is considered a historically essential primary instrument because it was among the first to allow pilots to maintain control without visual reference by showing the rate and quality of a turn[cite: 228]. While the attitude gyro is the primary instrument for instrument flight in modern practice, the turn-and-bank holds this fundamental distinction. The airspeed indicator is a primary flight instrument but does not provide the attitude reference needed for 'blind flying'."
