    "question_number": 1,
    "question": "The climb angle of the aircraft is equivalent to the flight path angle both in the vertical and horizontal direction.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only in the vertical direction"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The climb angle and flight path angle are related but not equivalent in both directions. The climb angle is the angle of ascent relative to the horizontal, while the flight path angle is between the velocity vector and the horizontal. They align in steady climb but not in both vertical and horizontal contexts simultaneously."

    "question": "The component of weight provides the force to create a change in direction of an aircraft maneuver.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only during level flight"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "During maneuvers like turns, the weight component (acting downward) contributes to the centripetal force needed for direction change, alongside lift from the wings."

    "question_number": 3,
    "question": "The rudder flaps induce a negative yaw axis.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only during a roll"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The term 'rudder flaps' is incorrect; the rudder controls yaw. Rudder deflection causes yaw in the same direction (e.g., right rudder causes right yaw, which is positive). Negative yaw (adverse yaw) is typically caused by ailerons, not the rudder."

  {
    "question_number": 4,
    "question": "The static stability of an aircraft tends to further move the aircraft after perturbation energy.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only in dynamic stability"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Static stability means the aircraft returns to its original position after a perturbation. If it 'further moves,' it indicates instability, not static stability."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 5,
    "question": "The horizontal stabilizer provides static stability.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only during takeoff"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The horizontal stabilizer provides longitudinal static stability by generating a restoring moment when the aircraft pitches, helping it return to equilibrium."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 6,
    "question": "Positive camber of an airfoil increases the total lift coefficient.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only at low speeds"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Positive camber increases the lift coefficient by enhancing the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil, effective across a range of speeds."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 7,
    "question": "CG is the point of action of the total weight of an aircraft.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only during flight"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The center of gravity (CG) is the point where the aircraft's total weight is considered to act, regardless of whether the aircraft is in flight or on the ground."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 8,
    "question": "Mach number is the ratio of air speed to the speed of sound.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only at sea level"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The Mach number is defined as the ratio of the aircraft's speed to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium, applicable at any altitude."

    "question_number": 9,
    "question": "Straight load factor = 1.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only during a turn"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In straight and level flight, the load factor (lift/weight) is 1, as lift equals weight to maintain altitude. This does not apply during turns, where the load factor increases."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 10,
    "question": "A monoplane wing structure is the highest wing loading.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only for fighter jets"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Wing loading depends on the aircraft's design, not just the monoplane structure. Biplanes often have lower wing loading due to larger wing area, while monoplanes vary (e.g., fighter jets have high wing loading, but not all monoplanes do)."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 11,
    "question": "The fuselage provides the maximum lift.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only during a stall"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The wings are the primary source of lift. The fuselage contributes minimally to lift and is mainly for structural support and housing, even during a stall."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 12,
    "question": "The aerodynamic force on an airfoil is due to the pressure and shear stress distribution over the wing.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only at high speeds"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Aerodynamic forces (lift and drag) result from pressure differences and shear stress on the airfoil surface, applicable across all speeds."

  {
    "question_number": 13,
    "question": "The wing tip vortices create induced drag.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only at low speeds"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Wing tip vortices form due to the pressure difference between the upper and lower wing surfaces, causing induced drag as a byproduct of lift, regardless of speed."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 14,
    "question": "The air flow over the wing is streamlined from the lower to the upper boundary layer.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only during a climb"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Airflow over a wing moves from the leading edge to the trailing edge, not 'from lower to upper boundary layer.' The boundary layer is the thin layer of air near the surface, and the description is incorrect."

  {
    "question_number": 15,
    "question": "The engine provides the energy to overcome the drag.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only during takeoff"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The engine generates thrust to counteract drag, maintaining or increasing speed throughout flight, not just during takeoff."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 16,
    "question": "The high lift devices such as slots and flaps increase the lift.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only at high speeds"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Slots and flaps increase lift by increasing the effective camber and delaying flow separation, primarily used at lower speeds (e.g., during takeoff and landing)."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 17,
    "question": "The center of pressure moves forward after stall.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only during a climb"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "After a stall, the center of pressure typically moves rearward due to the loss of lift at the leading edge and the shift in pressure distribution."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 18,
    "question": "The vortex generators create vortex to mix the air flow and delay boundary layer separation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only on the fuselage"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Vortex generators create small vortices to energize the boundary layer on the wings, delaying separation and improving control, not limited to the fuselage."

      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only on the ground"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The initial attitude (pitch, roll, yaw) is shown on an attitude indicator relative to the horizon, not 'from top to bottom,' which is not a standard display format."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 20,
    "question": "The stability of an aircraft exhibits further movement after perturbation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only in dynamic stability"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Stability (static or dynamic) means the aircraft returns to equilibrium after a perturbation. Further movement indicates instability, not stability."
  },
  {
    "question_number": 21,
    "question": "The lateral stability of an aircraft is about its longitudinal axis.",
    "options": {
      "A": "True",
      "B": "False",
      "C": "Only during a roll"
