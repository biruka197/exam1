      "a": "A carrier wave is a low-frequency signal that is powerful enough to travel long distances on its own without any modification. [cite: 221]",
      "b": "Modulation is the process of adding information, such as voice or data, to a high-frequency carrier wave, which is necessary because the information itself cannot travel far on its own. [cite: 201, 221]",
