        },
        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "A Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) is a unidirectional device, meaning it allows significant current to flow in only one direction, from the anode to the cathode, once it has been triggered on."

        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The output of an OR gate is HIGH if any of its inputs are HIGH. The only condition that results in a LOW output is when all inputs are simultaneously LOW (0)."

        },
        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "In Binary Coded Decimal (BCD), each decimal digit is represented by a four-bit binary number. The number 10001001 is split into two 4-bit groups: 1000 and 1001. The binary `1000` represents the decimal digit `8`, and the binary `1001` represents the decimal digit `9`. Together, they form the decimal number 89."

        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In semiconductor materials like silicon and germanium, atoms share their valence electrons with neighboring atoms to form stable covalent bonds, which gives the material its crystal structure and semiconductor properties."

        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In digital logic diagrams, a small circle or 'bubble' on an input or output line represents inversion (a NOT operation). A NAND gate is an AND gate followed by an inverter, and the bubble signifies this inversion."

        },
        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Adding a pentavalent (5 valence electrons) impurity to a semiconductor (like silicon with 4 valence electrons) introduces extra electrons that are free to move. Since electrons are negative charge carriers, this process, known as doping, creates an N-type semiconductor."

        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The Flight Management Computer (FMC) is the primary interface for pilots to input and manage the flight plan, performance, and navigation. This makes it a highly interactive system compared to the IRS (Inertial Reference System) and Air Data Computer, which are primarily data-sensing and-providing units."

        },
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "For an AND gate, the output is HIGH (1) only if all of its inputs are HIGH. If any input is LOW (0), the output is guaranteed to be LOW."

        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In semiconductor physics, a 'hole' denotes the absence of an electron in the valence band. Since an electron has a negative charge, its absence creates a localized net positive charge, and the hole is treated as a positive charge carrier."

        },
        "correct_answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The distance between the valence and conduction bands is the energy band gap. Insulators have the largest band gap, meaning the conduction band is furthest from the valence band, which is why they are poor conductors of electricity."

        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The effect of an external voltage depends on its polarity. A forward bias (positive to p-type, negative to n-type) will decrease the potential barrier, allowing current to flow. A reverse bias will increase the potential barrier, blocking current."

        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "An insulating mat is made from a non-conductive material designed to prevent the flow of electricity. Its purpose is to isolate a user or equipment from ground, thus providing no ground reference. Conductive and metal mats are used specifically to create a ground connection."
