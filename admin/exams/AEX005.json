        "question": "What is the primary function of a synchro transmitter?",
        "options": {
            "a": "To transmit position data",
            "b": "To amplify signals",
            "c": "To regulate voltage"
        },
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "A synchro transmitter, also called a synchro generator (CG), is connected to the rotating shaft whose position needs to be transmitted. It converts the mechanical angle into a set of electrical signals that represent that angle."
